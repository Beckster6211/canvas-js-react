        <h3>Hi 👋</h3>
        <p>
          During my time at School of Code we were shown Canvas. I enjoyed
          making pictures as it proved to be a good stress reliever, sometimes
          SoC can get a bit overwhelming (no offense meant, its still a fun
          course).
        </p>
        <p>
          After lots of playing I found a blog which showed how to make them
          responsive to screen size 🥳
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to see them visit the different pictures in the nav 😃
        </p>
        <p>👍 Hope you like them I had fun making them</p>
        <p>
          (I still have a small issue with the scaling so some are a bit fussy)
